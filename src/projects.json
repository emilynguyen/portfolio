This approach sets the app apart from its competitors by providing users a more fun, personalized stretching experience.</p><p>To encourage users to actually perform the stretches provided by the app, we decided to include a social feature.

Users then use metrics such as price and number of beds/baths to sort through the returned listings. Additional research could then be done to find walkability, safety scores, and more for an address. This user flow works great for those looking for homes in specific neighborhoods, but what if you wanted to choose a neighborhood based on a metric?</p>"
