I had the pleasure of joining Salesforce’s Global Enablement — Tech Ops team as a Visual Experience Design Intern.</p><p>Tech Ops built internal technology that helped streamline workplace operations and was working on an online learning platform when I came on board. I supported this project by leading usability testing sessions and utilizing my insights to assist in a UI redesign. I also created brand collateral for this product and provided additional visual communication needs.</p>",

Needs to be able to track their progress, enroll in classes, and receive notifications.</span></li></ul><p>At the time that I had joined the project, the product was in its third release. The lead UX designer on my team had recently left the company, but had completed user testing for the Enabler point of view beforehand. My task was to continue where she had left off and conduct usability testing for the Learner.</p><p>I was currently the only designer on Tech Ops, making this an intimidating task. I quickly learned the importance of being a self-starter and reached out to designers from other teams for mentorship. Using their guidance and the recordings + notes that the previous designer had left for me, I created a user testing plan and contacted 6 new hires across various positions for interviews. Afterwards, I synthesized my insights and presented them to my team.</p>"

While being able to exchange envelopes virtually is convenient, existing solutions are heavily gamified, detracting from the cultural focus that physical red envelope exchanges hold. I evaluated these solutions and surveyed Lunar New Year celebrants to discover how to translate the cultural aspects of the red envelope exchange into the user experience.</p><p>This project was inspired by my own experiences as a Vietnamese American.

          "content": "<p>In 2014, the massive Chinese messaging and mobile payment platform WeChat introduced a feature that allows users to send and receive virtual red envelopes. Several competing tech companies began rolling out similar functions. While these services solve our problem at a glance, I observed several major pain points of WeChat’s red packet feature:</p><h3>1. Too big of an emphasis placed on cash-based incentives.</h3><p>Cash incentives and gamification have caused virtual red envelope services to be met with criticism for turning the tradition into a monetary venture. Examples include:</p><ul><li><span>Users can send packets to groups and randomize the amounts in each envelope. In stark contrast, the amount of money in physical red envelopes is often chosen intentionally based on cultural beliefs.<img src='/images/red-envelope/wechat-random.png' alt='' style='max-width: 25rem;'></span></li><li><span>In 2014, a popular Chinese New Year special <a href='https://www.techinasia.com/wechat-1-billion-red-envelopes-chinese-new-year-2015' target='_blank'>used WeChat’s red packets to give away over $80 million</a> to its viewers. Users would shake their phones for a chance to win red envelopes.</span></li></ul><p>Additionally, the gamification of the red envelope exchange has turned it into an impersonal process, encouraging users to receive money from strangers. This makes users more <a href='https://www.techinasia.com/red-envelope-scams-on-wechat' target='_blank'>suspect to fraud</a>. Incidents have been reported of users falling for phishing attacks while “receiving” envelopes, hosting fake giveaways to gain followers, and more.</p><h3>2. Too similar to other mobile payment services.</h3><p>Underneath the themed interface, WeChat’s red packet feature functions exactly like Venmo, Cash App, and co. Users enter the amount they’d like to send, add a message to go along with it, and then confirm. The red + gold design and inclusion of envelope illustrations are the only aspects of the service that translate culture.<img src='/images/red-envelope/wechat-screens.png' alt='WeChat screens'></p><h3>3. Can only exchange between WeChat users.</h3><p>WeChat and its competitors have a predominantly Chinese user base, leaving a gap in the market. <a href='https://www.similarweb.com/blog/mobile-messaging-app-map-2018' target='_blank'>For 89% of the world, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger are the most popular messaging apps</a>.</p>"
