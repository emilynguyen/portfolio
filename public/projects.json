      "overview": "<p><a href='https://voxmedia.com/' target='_blank'>Vox Media</a> is a modern media company home to 7 unique editorial networks: Vox, The Verge, SB Nation, Polygon, Eater, Recode, and Curbed. With an audience of 750 million, Vox Media is committed to getting the future of media right through their innovative and diverse content.</p><p>This includes <a href='https://podcasts.voxmedia.com/' target='_blank'>Vox Media Podcast Network</a>, a fast-growing collection of 150+ shows spanning business, technology, news, sports, and dining. Each of these podcasts boast custom art, crafted thoughtfully by in-house designers. As the network grew, so did the need for a strong design system to consolidate all of this artwork. I joined Vox Media’s Brand Design team as their Brand Design Intern this summer, and was given the opportunity to tackle this challenge.</p><p>I first conducted a competitive analysis of our competitors’ design systems to identify how different guidelines influence or align with different elements of podcast art. I then audited our own artwork to pinpoint areas that could benefit from structured guidelines. After several rounds of explorations and meetings with stakeholders, I finalized a style guide and template system that established consistency across our assets and strengthened the brand recognition of Vox Media Podcast Network.</p><p>More on my process coming soon; stay tuned!</p>",

          "content": "<p>In 2014, the massive Chinese messaging and mobile payment platform WeChat introduced a feature that allows users to send and receive virtual red envelopes. Several competing tech companies began rolling out similar functions. While these services solve our problem at a glance, I observed several major pain points of WeChat’s red packet feature:</p><h3>1. Too big of an emphasis placed on cash-based incentives.</h3><p>Cash incentives and gamification have caused virtual red envelope services to be met with criticism for turning the tradition into a monetary venture. Examples include:</p><ul><li><span>Users can send packets to groups and randomize the amounts in each envelope. In stark contrast, the amount of money in physical red envelopes is often chosen intentionally based on cultural beliefs.<img src='/images/red-envelope/wechat-random.png' alt='' style='max-width: 25rem;'></span></li><li><span>In 2014, a popular Chinese New Year special <a href='https://www.techinasia.com/wechat-1-billion-red-envelopes-chinese-new-year-2015' target='_blank'>used WeChat’s red packets to give away over $80 million</a> to its viewers. Users would shake their phones for a chance to win red envelopes.</span></li></ul><p>Additionally, the gamification of the red envelope exchange has turned it into an impersonal process, encouraging users to receive money from strangers. This makes users more <a href='https://www.techinasia.com/red-envelope-scams-on-wechat' target='_blank'>suspect to fraud</a>. Incidents have been reported of users falling for phishing attacks while “receiving” envelopes, hosting fake giveaways to gain followers, and more.</p><h3>2. Too similar to other mobile payment services.</h3><p>Underneath the themed interface, WeChat’s red packet feature functions exactly like Venmo, Cash App, and co. Users enter the amount they’d like to send, add a message to go along with it, and then confirm. The red + gold design and inclusion of envelope illustrations are the only aspects of the service that translate culture.<img src='/images/red-envelope/wechat-screens.png' alt='WeChat screens'></p><h3>3. Can only exchange between WeChat users.</h3><p>WeChat and its competitors have a predominantly Chinese user base, leaving a gap in the market. <a href='https://www.similarweb.com/blog/mobile-messaging-app-map-2018' target='_blank'>For 89% of the world, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger are the most popular messaging apps</a>.</p>"
