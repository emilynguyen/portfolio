This approach sets the app apart from its competitors by providing users a more fun, personalized stretching experience.</p><p>To encourage users to actually perform the stretches provided by the app, we decided to include a social feature. Once a user is done setting up a routine, they could share their settings with their friends or coworkers so that they all receive the same notifications.
