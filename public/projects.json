Needs to be able to track their progress, enroll in classes, and receive notifications.</li></ul><p>At the time that I had joined the project, the product was in its third release. The lead UX designer on my team had recently left the company, but had completed user testing for the Enabler point of view beforehand. My task was to continue where she had left off and conduct usability testing for the Learner.</p><p>I was currently the only designer on Tech Ops, making this an intimidating task. I quickly learned the importance of being a self-starter and reached out to designers from other teams for mentorship. Using their guidance and the recordings + notes that the previous designer had left for me, I created a user testing plan and contacted 6 new hires across various positions for interviews. Afterwards, I synthesized my insights and presented them to my team.</p>"

I analyzed the card designs used by popular online learning platforms, such as Trailhead 🙊, Codecademy, and Treehouse, to discover the best way to organize and display information. As someone interested in both visual and UX, it was exciting to see how these fields intersect to create fluid digital experiences.</p>"
